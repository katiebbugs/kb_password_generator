On-the-Job Ticket: take existing HTML, CSS, Javascript code and add working Javascript code to generate the random password.

    User Story
    AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
    I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

    Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    WHEN prompted for password criteria
    THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
    THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    WHEN I answer each prompt
    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    WHEN all prompts are answered
    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    WHEN the password is generated
    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Edits Made: organized code and created Javascript formula to create random password

    Organized HTML and CSS code
    Created Javascript prompt and confirm questions
    Organized Javascript answers for chosen character list
    Create Javascript for loop and random math to generate random password at the chosen length wit the chosen characters
